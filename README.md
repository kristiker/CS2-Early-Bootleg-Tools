### ShaderRenamer
ShaderRenamer allows you to author Counter-Strike compatible materials in HL: Alyx. Simply run it once from within the Half-Life Alyx folder to generate the necessary shaders. The materials compiled using these new "aliases" can be used in Counter-Strike 2 maps.

### MapPacker
MapPacker packs the necessary assets (materials, textures) into the map file, so it can be moved to Counter-Strike 2 as one package. It is best if the materials in the map use the aforementioned shaders.

### gameinfo.gi
Contains the necessary edits to compile Counter-Strike 2 compatible maps in HL: Alyx (with lighting). Backup your game/hlvr/gameinfo.gi and replace it with this one.
